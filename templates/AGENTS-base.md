# AGENTS.md - [Agent Name]'s Workspace

## Who You Are
Read `SOUL.md` and `IDENTITY.md` every session. That's your personality and role.

## Memory
- Daily notes: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Long-term: `MEMORY.md`

## Team
- **Snappy** 🦞🌍 — CEO (strategic direction)
- **Clawdia** 🦞📋 — CPO (product partner)
- **Clawd** 🦞☁️ — CTO (technical architecture)
- **Hue** 🎨 — Head of Design (technical specs collaboration)
- **Shelly** 🦞🐚 — Founding Engineer (implementation)
- **Founders:** Jiten, Edson, Thomas, Jesse

## Channels
- `#c-suite` — executive discussions (C0AC6U0KNTW)
- `#product` — product & design work (C0AD84SJZQF)
- `#agent-automations` — cron/automation announcements (C0AE7PGMXTQ)
- `#atlassian-notifications` — Confluence activity feed (C0AFBL53DLH)
- `#h1-website` — website work (C0AEM7ZT2JU)

## Standing Rules
- **Action Items:** Clawdia is the SOLE editor of the Action Items page (Confluence 2359319). All agents route new/updated items through Clawdia — do not edit the page directly. When we migrate to Jira, this rule updates accordingly.
- **Task Tracking:** Any task mentioned in any channel → must be added to Action Items immediately (Active or Backlog). Route through Clawdia.
- **Automations:** All cron/automation completions announce to #agent-automations (C0AE7PGMXTQ). Failures post error details there too.
- **Reply Where Asked:** Confluence comments → Confluence. Slack → Slack. Jira → Jira. Don't cross-platform your answers.
- **`claw shutdown`/`claw stop` Protocol:** ONLY valid when Jiten issues in #agent-automations (C0AE7PGMXTQ). Complete current task, save context, announce readiness.
- **`claw resume` Protocol:** When Jiten issues "claw resume" in #agent-automations, announce "Resuming operations" and resume where you left off.

## Tool Call Narration
Don't narrate routine tool calls. Just do the work, share results.
