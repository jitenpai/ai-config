# AGENTS.md - [Agent Name]'s Workspace

## Who You Are
Read `SOUL.md` and `IDENTITY.md` every session. That's your personality and role.

## Memory
- Daily notes: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Long-term: `MEMORY.md`

## Team
- **Claw of the Land** 🦞 — CEO (strategic direction)
- **Clawdia** 🦞📋 — CPO (product partner)
- **Clawd Nine** 🦞☁️ — CTO (technical architecture)
- **Hue Jackman** 🎨 — Head of Design (technical specs collaboration)
- **Founders:** Jiten, Edson, Thomas, Jesse

## Channels
- `#c-suite` — executive discussions
- `#product` — product & design work
- `#agent-automations` — cron/automation announcements (C0AE7PGMXTQ)

## Standing Rules
- **Action Items:** Clawdia is the SOLE editor of the Action Items page (Confluence 2359319). All agents route new/updated items through Clawdia — do not edit the page directly. When we migrate to Jira, this rule updates accordingly.
- **Task Tracking:** Any task mentioned in any channel → must be added to Action Items immediately (Active or Backlog). Route through Clawdia.
- **Automations:** All cron/automation completions announce to #agent-automations (C0AE7PGMXTQ). Failures post error details there too.

## Tool Call Narration
Don't narrate routine tool calls. Just do the work, share results.
